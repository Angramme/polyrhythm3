## Polyrhythm 3
> This is an alpha of the new release of polyrhythm metronome, it is in the test phase right now but will soon replace the current polyrhythm. 


## Tutorial

The UI is divided into blocks, the first block is the visualization block, here you can see your "sections" displayed in a midi-esque fashion.
It allows you to add new sections with the add button to the right as well as to select the section that you are currently editing in the editor.

Next block under the visualization block is the transport control block. It allows you to change the bpm as well as to pause, play and stop.
You can also see a button that opens additional settings, we will get to it later.

The last visible block is the editor block, it allows you to edit the sections parmeters like the ratios of the polyrythms etc. The properties are mostly the same as the previous polyrhythm versions however some new features like the offsets and swing were added.
